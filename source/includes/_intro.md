# Introduction

Welcome to the Import.io API! 

This documentation describes how to use our API to access Import.io API endpoints, which allow you to leverage the Import.io platform to configure and retrieve data, reports and attachments.  

It's important to note that we've separated the API documentation into two primary sections: the first section is called "Maestro" and is intended to be a more user-friendly and approachable API that should cover most common use cases.  In the second section, we describe our underlying external API endpoints for more advanced or non-standard integrations.  If you have an use case for the platform API that we don't cover, please reach out and we'll help you figure out how to get it done or work to get it on the platform roadmap.

We currently have language examples in Python and Javascript that we're working to extend and expand upon.  We're also working to create and expose public repositories for usage examples in each language, and will update this document with links and usage instructions as they become available. You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.
